# Modeling Key Encapsulation Mechanisms in EasyCrypt

EasyCrypt library that generically defines Key Encapsulation Mechanisms
(KEMs), Public-Key Encryption (PKE) schemes, and their properties (both
correctness and security), including the Random Oracle Model (ROM).  For
convenience, it also provides some sensible defaults, particularly for
oracles.  Most of the content is based on relevant literature.

Includes generic instantiations of KEMs based on variation of the
Fujisaki-Okamoto transform.
